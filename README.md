This repository holds the code for the analysis of multi-year drought periods conducted for the research in my ongoing research project titled: 'Unravelling dynamic patterns of socioeconomic impacts of drought during multi-year drought periods'.

The main analysis is conducted in the document main_analysis.qmd which is reproducible following a .qmd file. Required data is provided within the data folder. Thereby, the analysis can be replicated and followed-up.
